# Sudoku TODO

Known gaps and unscheduled work for this game. Not a changelog — delete
entries as they land. See the root `TODO.md` for the naming rules.

### sudoku-conflict-highlight-one-sided — Only the last-typed cell of a clash turns red

`placeDigit()` (`games/sudoku/script.js`) re-renders the cell just typed into and
nothing else:

```js
grid[r][c] = digit;
renderCell(r, c);        // the typed cell only
```

`renderCell()` decides `.wrong` from `conflicts(r, c)`, which is symmetric — both
members of a duplicate pair return true. But the *other* member is never
re-rendered, so it keeps whatever class it last had. Type 4 into an empty cell,
then 4 into another empty cell in the same row: the second turns red, the first
stays plain, even though both are equally part of the clash. Reversing the order
reverses which one is marked — it is always the last one typed, not the wrong one.

Reproduced headless at both cells of a row pair: `conflicts()` returns true for
each, and only the second carries `.wrong`.

`DESIGN.md` promises a conflicting digit is marked "live as it's typed", and half
of every conflict is unmarked, so a player clearing the red cell can be left with
a board that looks clean and is not. Winning is unaffected — `checkWin()` rescans
the grid and ignores the stale classes — which is why the suite never caught it.

The fix is to re-render the affected peers as well; `peers(r, c)` is already
defined in the same file and is what `conflicts()` uses. Clearing a cell has the
same gap in reverse: emptying one half of a pair should un-mark the other, which
also needs the peers re-rendered.

It predates the redesign and has been here as long as the live-conflict check has.
It was found during a pre-merge review and filed rather than fixed, because a
game's area belongs to its own branch.

`tests/sudoku.test.js` asserts only that the newly-typed duplicate is marked, so
whatever fixes this needs a case asserting the *older* cell of the pair is marked
too — that assertion fails today, which is the proof it is testing the right
thing.

### sudoku-famous-puzzles-mode — A mode built on curated, named puzzles

The bundled set in `games/sudoku/script.js` — 23 puzzles as of writing — is
procedurally generated and quality-checked against `DESIGN.md`'s "What makes a
puzzle good" — deliberately, so there's no attribution or manual-verification
burden. That rules out puzzles that are famous *because of who made them or
what record they hold* — Arto Inkala's "AI Escargot" and world's-hardest
puzzles, the "Everest" and "Golden Nugget" grids, and so on. Those only work
as a named, curated set: each hand-sourced, each still run through
`tests/sudoku-puzzles.test.js` for legality and uniqueness (that check is
generator-agnostic), but the source and name kept alongside the entry
instead of being anonymous.

Likely its own mode alongside "New puzzle" — cycling through 5-10 named
puzzles rather than folding them into the 100 — since mixing generated and
curated puzzles in one list would need a way to tell them apart or lose the
point of naming them. Discuss the shape with Gabriel before building; this
entry exists to record the idea, not a decided design.

### sudoku-status-line-duplicate-instructions — The start prompt never clears, and now repeats the panel

`loadPuzzle()` (`games/sudoku/script.js`) sets `#status` to "Select a cell, then
type a digit" and nothing ever clears it — it sits there for the whole game
until "Solved! 🎉" replaces it on a win. CLAUDE.md's page contract says
`#status` is game state only, and standing instructions belong in the
collapsible panel instead. Minesweeper clears its own start prompt after the
first reveal (`tests/instructions-panel.test.js` §4 pins that behaviour), so
Sudoku is the odd one out here.

This predates the How to play panel added on `sudoku-how-to-play`, but that
branch made it visible in a new way: the panel's Controls section now says
"Click a cell, then type a digit or use the number pad" — almost the same
sentence sitting permanently in `#status` above it. Fix by clearing `#status`
after the first successful `placeDigit`, the same shape as Minesweeper's fix.
